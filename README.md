# understat_betfair_scrap
Scripts scraping stats from Understats and Odds from Betfair.
Understat scraping is totally free and no sign up at their website is needed - just run the code.
In order to use the Betfair scripts though, you'd need to 1)have access to betfair (some countries restrict it) 2)log in to your betfair account 3)Connect to Betfair API - explained here: https://developer.betfair.com/en/get-started/ 
You will need to generate your API application Key and Session Token.
Also, beware of the filepaths to save out files. Excel spreadsheet files are saved out by the scripts.
